# simple-text-editor
Simple text editor for basic formatting functions for text


Project was created with Ae sceletor on react, so 
to run this application you need to do this steps: 

# npm install

# npm run build

after last command project will open on you browser

there is only one page, near center is a main functinpality, formating text

all functionality works on doubleclick event

on the left hand side, is DataMuse it a query for synonyms for words in right box

you can click any wrods, synonyms automaticaly loaded and replace this word with 
some synonym.

Text editor is sensetive, you able to set bold weight and italic in the same time, 
and it with same sensetivese it will removed formatting on second click

 <!_!> P.S. I really wanted to implement content editable block, it was good challange
 to try create text editor in react where child nodes will not be tracked by react in content editable
 block, and i almost did it, but this version has many pure js code. 
 Thanks for Task,
